# static-utils

All code here is written by others and publicly available. It is just organized here for easy sharing of dependencies. 

Additionally, these are other GitHub repositories that I use:

- [Climate Data Toolbox](https://github.com/chadagreene/CDT)
- [export_fig](https://github.com/altmany/export_fig)
- [jLab](https://github.com/jonathanlilly/jLab)
